# hide-drafts-and-private-posts-from-menu
The WprdPress plugin hides posts, pages and custom post types from the menu, which have draft or personal status if the website is viewed by someone who does not have the right to see them.

Sometimes itâ€™s convenient to create the complete desired hierarchy with draft pages in the menu, and then compose and publish these pages one by one.
